#Election System in C
This project is a simple command-line based election system implemented in C. It allows users to register as voters, vote for one of four parties, view their own voting details, and display the election results.

**Features:**
>Voter Registration: Users can register by providing their name and age. Only users aged 18 and above are eligible to vote.
>Voting: Registered users can vote for one of four parties.
>Display Details: Users can view their own voting details, including their name, age, and the party they voted for.
>Display Results: The system calculates and displays the total votes received by each party at any time.
**Usage:**
1)Clone the repository to your local machine.
2)Compile the election_system.c file using a C compiler.
3)Run the compiled executable.
4)Follow the on-screen prompts to register, vote, view details, or display results.
**Future Improvements:**
.Add authentication mechanisms to ensure the security of the voting process.
.Implement data persistence to store voter information and election results.
.Create a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
